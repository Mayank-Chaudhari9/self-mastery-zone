Ques 2: Create two threads such that both of them at first call a common function doSomething() where on the basis of their thread_id they are assigned different tasks to do.

Task1 -> print no 0-9
Task2 -> print no 10-20

Constraitns:
	1-> you can choose/hardcode which thread can do what task
	2-> once A task is started the other task can not interrupt it.

Expected o/p (any one of the two cases is acceptable)
	
	case1:
		0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	
		10	11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18	19

	Case2:
		10	11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18	19	
		0	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8       9


Hint: Read about synchronization, mutex, join.
